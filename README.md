# Dos-Attack-Detection
This project is created using a Hybrid Model in Machine Learning
Here we make use of 4 different ML algorithms to build the model
The respective Data is split into Train data (80%) and Test data (20%). Then the Train data is again split into Training set (80% of Train data) and Validation set (20% of Train data). After splitting them, we send the validation set as an input to 
the three different algorithms (SVM, KNN, Na√Øve Bayes) to make predictions through the respective algorithms.
